# Visual Basic Fundamentals

Welcome to my **Visual Basic .NET** learning repository! ensuring clean, foundational code examples for beginners.

This repository contains various console applications demonstrating core programming concepts in VB.NET.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (Version 10.0 or later)
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or Visual Studio.

## Projects Overview

This repository is organized into separate folders for each concept:

### 1. MyFirstApp (`/MyFirstApp`)
- **Concept**: Basic Input/Output.
- **Description**: A "Hello World" application that also prompts the user for their name and prints a personalized greeting.
- **Run Command**:
  ```bash
  cd MyFirstApp
  dotnet run
  ```

### 2. Sum Calculator (`/sum`)
- **Concept**: Variables and Arithmetic.
- **Description**: A simple calculator that takes two integer inputs from the user and displays their sum. Demonstrates data type conversion and variable assignment.
- **Run Command**:
  ```bash
  cd sum
  dotnet run
  ```

### 3. Control Structures (`/contrrolstructures`)
- **Concept**: Conditional Logic (`If...ElseIf...Else`).
- **Description**: demonstrating how to make decisions in code based on variable values. Checks if a sum is greater than, less than, or equal to 10.
- **Run Command**:
  ```bash
  cd contrrolstructures
  dotnet run
  ```

### 4. Registration Form (`/forms`)
- **Concept**: Structured Data Entry.
- **Description**: A console-based "form" that simulates a user registration process. Captures multiple fields (Name, Age, Email) and displays a formatted summary.
- **Run Command**:
  ```bash
  cd forms
  dotnet run
  ```

## How to Run

1.  Open your terminal/command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the specific project folder (e.g., `cd forms`).
3.  Execute the program using:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
